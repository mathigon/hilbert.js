Hilbert.ts is a TypeScript library for expression parsing, simplification, and
MathML rendering. It was developed for [Mathigon.org](https://mathigon.org), an
award-winning mathematics education project.


## Open Issues

* [ ] Support for functions with subscripts (e.g. `log_a(b)`).
* [ ] Support for large operators (sum, product and integral).
* [ ] Parse ^ and _ operator from right to left (e.g. `2^2^2 == 2^(2^2)`).
* [ ] CAS Expression simplification algorithms, `equals()` and `same()` methods.
* [ ] More tests, including visual tests for MathML.


## Usage

First, install Hilbert.ts from [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mathigon/hilbert)
using

```npm install @mathigon/hilbert```

Now, simply import all functions and classes you need, using

```js
import {Expression} from '@mathigon/hilbert'
```
